Why Use a Backend?
Data Management: The backend handles data storage, retrieval, and updates using databases. For example, user information, product details, or messages are stored and managed here.
Business Logic: It contains the rules and logic of how your application functions. For instance, calculating totals, applying discounts, or verifying user credentials.
Security: The backend ensures sensitive operations, like authentication and payment processing, are done securely without exposing them to the user.
Performance: Offloading complex computations and operations to the backend ensures the frontend remains responsive and lightweight.
Scalability: The backend is essential for managing multiple users, data-heavy operations, or growing the application's features without overwhelming the frontend.


What Does It Do?
API Management: Provides an interface (APIs) for the frontend to communicate with the server and database.
Authentication and Authorization: Handles user login, password management, and access control.
Database Interaction: Reads from and writes to databases, ensuring data consistency and validation.
Processing Requests: Handles operations like form submissions, file uploads, and search queries.
Serving Content: Delivers static (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and dynamic content (generated by frameworks like Node.js, Django, or Spring).

What is the Purpose of a Backend?
The backend serves as the brain of the application. Its main purpose is to:
Support the frontend by providing data and functionality.
Enable interconnectivity between the app, databases, and external services.
Ensure security and proper handling of data.
Optimize application performance by efficiently handling user requests.

/**
 * What is the `npm init` Command?
 * --------------------------------
 * 1. `npm init` is a command used to initialize a new Node.js project.
 * 2. It creates a `package.json` file in the current directory.
 * 3. This file acts as a configuration and metadata file for your project.
 *
 * What Does `npm init` Do?
 * ------------------------
 * - Prompts you for project details like name, version, description, etc.
 * - Prepares your project to manage dependencies.
 * - Helps to define scripts (like starting the server, running tests, etc.).
 * 
 * Running `npm init`:
 * -------------------
 * 1. In interactive mode:
 *    - Type `npm init` in your terminal.
 *    - Youâ€™ll be prompted for details like project name, version, description, etc.
 * 
 * 2. For default configuration:
 *    - Use `npm init -y` or `npm init --yes`.
 *    - This skips the prompts and creates a `package.json` file with default values.
 * 
 * Example `package.json` File:
 * ----------------------------
 * After running `npm init`, the following file will be created:
 * 
 * {
 *   "name": "travelstory-backend", // Name of your project
 *   "version": "1.0.0",            // Version of your project
 *   "description": "A backend for TravelStory", // Brief about the project
 *   "main": "index.js",            // Entry point file (default is index.js)
 *   "scripts": {                   // Custom scripts for automation
 *     "start": "node index.js",    // Example: Start server with `npm start`
 *     "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
 *   },
 *   "author": "Boss",              // Your name
 *   "license": "ISC"               // License type (default is ISC)
 * }
 * 
 * Why Use `npm init`?
 * -------------------
 * 1. To set up a new Node.js project.
 * 2. To manage project dependencies (packages or libraries your app relies on).
 * 3. To automate tasks using custom scripts.
 * 4. To provide project metadata for maintainers and collaborators.
 * 
 * After Running `npm init`:
 * -------------------------
 * - A `package.json` file is created in your project directory.
 * - You can now:
 *   1. Install packages using `npm install <package-name>`.
 *   2. Run scripts using `npm run <script-name>`.
 *   3. Manage your project efficiently.
 * 
 * Example Commands:
 * -----------------
 * - `npm install express` (Installs the Express.js package for server creation).
 * - `npm start` (Runs the script defined as `"start"` in `package.json`).
 * - `npm test` (Runs the script defined as `"test"` in `package.json`).

scripts in package file
***********************

/**
 * What Are Scripts in `package.json`?
 * -----------------------------------
 * - Scripts are shortcuts for running commonly used commands in your project.
 * - Defined under the `scripts` section of `package.json`.
 * - You can execute these scripts using `npm run <script-name>`.

 * Example Scripts:
 * ----------------
 * {
 *   "scripts": {
 *     "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1", // Placeholder for tests
 *     "start": "nodemon index.js"                          // Starts the app with Nodemon
 *   }
 * }

 * Explanation:
 * ------------
 * 1. `"test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"`:
 *    - Placeholder for a testing script.
 *    - Currently outputs an error message and exits with code 1.
 *    - Replace this with an actual testing command (e.g., `jest`) when tests are implemented.

 * 2. `"start": "nodemon index.js"`:
 *    - Runs `nodemon index.js` to start the app.
 *    - Nodemon watches for file changes and restarts the app automatically.
 *    - Useful during development to avoid manually restarting the server.

 * Why Use Scripts?
 * ----------------
 * - **Automation**: Simplifies running frequent tasks like starting the server or testing.
 * - **Consistency**: Ensures the same commands are used across all team members or environments.
 * - **Convenience**: Saves time by avoiding long or complex commands.

 * How to Run These Scripts:
 * -------------------------
 * 1. Run the `test` script:
 *    - Command: `npm test`
 *    - Output: `Error: no test specified` (until replaced with a proper test script).

 * 2. Run the `start` script:
 *    - Command: `npm start`
 *    - This starts the app using Nodemon, which restarts the app automatically when files change.
