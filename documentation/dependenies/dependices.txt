/**
 * Explanation of the Packages Used in the Project:
 * ----------------------------------------------
 * 1. **bcrypt** (`^5.1.1`):
 *    - **Purpose**: Hash passwords securely.
 *    - **What It Can Do**: 
 *      - Hashes passwords before storing them in a database to protect sensitive data.
 *      - Compares hashed passwords for authentication.
 *      - Adds salt to hashing to prevent rainbow table attacks.
 *    
 * 2. **cors** (`^2.8.5`):
 *    - **Purpose**: Enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS).
 *    - **What It Can Do**:
 *      - Allows requests from different origins (domains, ports) to access the server's resources.
 *      - Prevents CORS errors in frontend applications hosted on different domains.
 *      - Can be configured to allow specific origins, methods, and headers.
 *    
 * 3. **dotenv** (`^16.4.7`):
 *    - **Purpose**: Load environment variables from a `.env` file.
 *    - **What It Can Do**:
 *      - Allows managing sensitive information (e.g., database credentials, API keys) outside the code.
 *      - Helps maintain different configurations for development and production environments.
 *      - Loads environment variables into `process.env` for easy access.
 *    
 * 4. **express** (`^4.21.2`):
 *    - **Purpose**: Web framework for Node.js.
 *    - **What It Can Do**:
 *      - Simplifies HTTP request handling and routing in a Node.js server.
 *      - Helps build RESTful APIs with various HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
 *      - Provides middleware support for tasks like authentication, error handling, etc.
 *    
 * 5. **jsonwebtoken** (`^9.0.2`):
 *    - **Purpose**: Create and verify JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
 *    - **What It Can Do**:
 *      - Helps implement token-based authentication for APIs.
 *      - Creates JWTs for user login sessions and verifies tokens for protected routes.
 *      - Allows stateless authentication without storing session data on the server.
 *    
 * 6. **mongoose** (`^8.9.5`):
 *    - **Purpose**: MongoDB object modeling tool for Node.js.
 *    - **What It Can Do**:
 *      - Provides an ODM (Object Data Modeling) framework to interact with MongoDB.
 *      - Defines data models (schemas) for MongoDB collections and performs CRUD operations.
 *      - Handles data validation, relationships, and query building.
 *    
 * 7. **nodemon** (`^3.1.9`):
 *    - **Purpose**: Automatically restarts the Node.js server on file changes.
 *    - **What It Can Do**:
 *      - Watches the codebase for changes and automatically restarts the server during development.
 *      - Helps in rapid development by removing the need for manually restarting the server.
 *      - Useful for real-time updates when working on APIs or backend applications.
